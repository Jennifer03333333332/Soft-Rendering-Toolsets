*In command lines, when I use './drawsvg ../svg/basic' to observe all the svg,
when I press'1', it shows test2.svg, when I press '2' or '3' it shows test6.svg and test7.svg. I don't know what's going on.
Task 1:
    Fully implemented.
    glBegin and glEnd will basically define how vertices made inside of this will be interpreted.
    glColor3f() mush be put before other actions

Task 2:
    Fully implemented.
    Using Bresenham's algorithm to implement drawing lines, then usexiaolinwu algorhitm based on the code in wiki
    Code: SoftwareRendererImp::rasterize_line_Bresenham() and SoftwareRendererImp::rasterize_line_xiaolinwu()

Task 3:
    Fully implemented.
    Using SoftwareRendererImp::inside_triangle() to judge if point p is inside the triangle or not. 
    Using a 2D-bounding box.
    Could judge counter-clockwise and clockwise for vertices.
    Covered points on the triangles' edge

Task 4:

    Fully implemented.
    SuperSampling Anti-Aliasing(SSAA)
    Faced with many problems with float type and uint8_t type precision
    Change the data structure a lot, super_sample_buffer from unsigned char array to vector<uint8_t>, then to vector<float>
    Steps:
    //1 Have render_target already. Create a new super_sample_buffer. the length would be rate*rate times than render_target
    //2 Rasterize based on super_sample_buffer
    //3 Resolve it to render_target

Task 5:

    Fully implemented.

Task 6:

    Fully implemented.

Task 7:

    Fully implemented.

Task 8:

    Fully implemented.
